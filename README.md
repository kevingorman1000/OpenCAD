# Disclosure of Fork
This version of OpenCAD is based on the original source from [Shane Gill](https://github.com/ossified/openCad).

# Changing Department Icons

#### Disclaimer

I am not the original dev of this CAD. You can find that information above. I have just taken the files, worked on them and resolved some issues. I am NOT a PHP developer so my code may not be pretty but it's functional, I'll modify and pretty up the code when I can.
